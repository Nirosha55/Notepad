What is JavaScript?
------------------
Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and
most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow
client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an
interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to
JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java.
JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the
name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been
embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

* The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language:-
 JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
 Designed for creating network-centric applications.
 Complementary to and integrated with Java.
 Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
 Open and cross-platform.

Advantages of JavaScript?
------------------------
The merits of using JavaScript are:-
 Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
 Immediate feedback to the visitors: They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
 Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
 Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as dragand-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.


Limitations of JavaScript:-
-------------------------
We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the
following important features:
 Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This
has been kept for security reason.
 JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no
such support available.
 JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.
Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that
allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed
within the 
<script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.




You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within
you web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within
the <head> tags.
The <script> tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text
between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as
follows.
<script ...>
 JavaScript code
</script>
The script tag takes two important attributes:
 Language: This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using.
Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML
(and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.
 Type: This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting
language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript".
So your JavaScript syntax will look as follows.
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
 JavaScript code
</script>
